Project: Recipes

Start Date: 05.11.2021

Description: My first Odin Project, seems simple I just have to make a website with a few linked pages of recipes.
	     I'll take recipes from online and a few images, make sure it has all the steps to the cooking, I'll do an ordered list for it.
	     Write a few paragraphs about cooking myself or take some from a motivational blog or cooking site.

Skills used: HTML, Git, images, website linking, folder organization
