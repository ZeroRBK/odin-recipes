        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>I had never seen or tried blueberry soup until a recent vacation to Italy. A Swedish couple we met told me about all about it over dinner one night. Apparently, it’s a very common dish in the winter for breakfast in areas of Sweden. It’s often served at ski resorts around the country to help warm up skiers after a day of snow-filled activities.</p>
        <p>Warm blueberries stewed in lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and a hint of maple syrup creates the coziest bowl of goodness you’ve ever had. Top it with a dollop of greek yogurt and toasted almonds and you have a filling breakfast that the whole family will love.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
